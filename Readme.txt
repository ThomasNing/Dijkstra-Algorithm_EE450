Description: 
  The part of extra credit and requirement material are all completed. Because I
rank the minimum path tree in the order of each nodes. Therefore, the path tree of node 3
print out before the node 4. In the requirement pdf, the terminal first prints out the node 4
first but not node 3. I hope that will not violate the rule, because I have correctly stated out the 
pathing tree by edge correctly.
  Part of the codes use for reference of Geeksforgeeks. I use the Geeksforgeeks to help me 
comprehends the algorithm better.
